# Security Policy

Security is very important for HSB Learnings and its community. 🔒

## Versions

The latest version of CalcHub is supported.

You are encouraged to use the latest version of the app to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: hsb.learns@gmail.com.

Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps to reproduce the security issue.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. 🙊

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
